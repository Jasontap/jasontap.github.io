# Welcome to my webpage

## My name is 
# Jason Williams
I am a Software Engineer experienced in Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, Node.js, React, Redux, Express,  
Sequelize ORM, PostgreSQL, Web Sockets, Flex Box, and Bootstrap3.

After completing the immersive coding bootcamp at Fullstack Academy in April 2021,  
It has become my passion to continue learning, growing, and taking on new challenges as a professional  
developer.  
I am seeking employment with a company that not only pushes the boundaries of technology but also  
inspires me to be the best software engineer I can be.
